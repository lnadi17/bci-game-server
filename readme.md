# BCI Game Server

This repository contains scripts for working with EEG data streams using the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) and MNE-Python. The scripts demonstrate how to stream, process, and visualize EEG data in real-time.

## Files Overview

### 1. `mne_player_lsl.py`
This script demonstrates how to play a sample EEG dataset using MNE-LSL's `PlayerLSL`. It streams the data in chunks and repeats it a specified number of times.

#### Key Features:
- Streams EEG data from a sample `.fif` file.
- Configurable chunk size and repeat count.

#### Usage:
```bash
python mne_player_lsl.py
```

---

### 2. `pylsl_pull_chunk.py`
This script shows how to resolve available LSL streams and pull data chunks from a selected stream using `pylsl`.

#### Key Features:
- Resolves available LSL streams on the network.
- Allows the user to select a stream by index.
- Pulls and prints data chunks from the selected stream.

#### Usage:
```bash
python pylsl_pull_chunk.py
```

---

### 3. `mne_realtime.py`
This script connects to an LSL stream, processes the incoming data in real-time, and optionally saves it to a `.fif` file.

#### Key Features:
- Connects to an LSL stream using `StreamLSL`.
- Processes and prints new data chunks in real-time.
- Saves the data to a `.fif` file for later analysis.

#### Usage:
```bash
python mne_realtime.py
```

---

### 4. `plot_recording.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook visualizes the EEG data saved in a `.fif` file.

#### Key Features:
- Reads and loads the `.fif` file containing EEG data.
- Displays metadata about the recording.
- Plots the first 10 seconds of the EEG data.

#### Usage:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook plot_recording.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells to visualize the data.

## Notes

- Ensure that an LSL-compatible EEG device or stream is available on the network for real-time streaming scripts.
- The `recordings/` directory is used to store `.fif` files generated by `mne_realtime.py`.
